# airbnb-clone-project
A comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb.

# Airbnb Clone Backend

## Project Overview
This is the backend system for the **Airbnb Clone Project**, engineered to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb. It provides a scalable, secure, and modular infrastructure to manage user interactions, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payment transactions. Designed for clarity and integration, this project supports REST and GraphQL APIs.

## Project Goals
- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile updates.
- **Property Management**: CRUD operations for property listings.
- **Booking System**: Reservation management with check-in/out features.
- **Payment Processing**: Transaction handling and record-keeping.
- **Review System**: User-generated ratings and reviews.
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexed queries and strategic caching.

## Tech Stack
- **Django**: python web framework building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framwework**: provides tools for creating and managing RESTFul APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles

Building a scalable Airbnb Clone involves collaboration across several specialized roles. Each contributes to delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly backend.

### Backend Developer
Responsible for creating and maintaining the RESTful and GraphQL APIs. This includes implementing authentication logic, business rules, and integrating key features such as booking workflows, payment processing, and review management.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the PostgreSQL database schema. Ensures optimized queries, indexes, and relationships between entities (Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.), while also maintaining data integrity, backups, and security.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles infrastructure automation, deployment, and monitoring. Manages Docker containers, configures CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions, and ensures the backend remains scalable and reliable under load.

### QA Engineer
Tests all backend endpoints and features. Writes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to identify bugs, validate functionality, and enforce performance standards. Also verifies API documentation aligns with implemented behavior.
