# airbnb-clone-project
A comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb.

# Airbnb Clone Backend

## Project Overview
This is the backend system for the **Airbnb Clone Project**, engineered to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb. It provides a scalable, secure, and modular infrastructure to manage user interactions, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payment transactions. Designed for clarity and integration, this project supports REST and GraphQL APIs.

## Project Goals
- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile updates.
- **Property Management**: CRUD operations for property listings.
- **Booking System**: Reservation management with check-in/out features.
- **Payment Processing**: Transaction handling and record-keeping.
- **Review System**: User-generated ratings and reviews.
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexed queries and strategic caching.

## Tech Stack
- **Django**: python web framework building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framwework**: provides tools for creating and managing RESTFul APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles

Building a scalable Airbnb Clone involves collaboration across several specialized roles. Each contributes to delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly backend.

### Backend Developer
Responsible for creating and maintaining the RESTful and GraphQL APIs. This includes implementing authentication logic, business rules, and integrating key features such as booking workflows, payment processing, and review management.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the PostgreSQL database schema. Ensures optimized queries, indexes, and relationships between entities (Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.), while also maintaining data integrity, backups, and security.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles infrastructure automation, deployment, and monitoring. Manages Docker containers, configures CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions, and ensures the backend remains scalable and reliable under load.

### QA Engineer
Tests all backend endpoints and features. Writes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to identify bugs, validate functionality, and enforce performance standards. Also verifies API documentation aligns with implemented behavior.

## Technology Stack

### Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework used to build robust, scalable web applications quickly. In an Airbnb-like project, Django helps by:
- **Managing Listings** & Users: Handles property listings, user authentication, and profiles.
- **Database Integration**: Simplifies storing and retrieving data (like bookings, reviews) using its ORM.
- **Security**: Provides built-in protections (against SQL injection, CSRF, etc.).
- **Admin Interface**: Offers a ready-to-use admin panel for managing site content.
- **URL Routing & Templates**: Organizes site navigation and renders dynamic page

### Django REST Framework
Django REST Framework (DRF) is a toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. DRF helps by:
- **Creating APIs**: Easily builds RESTful endpoints for listings, bookings, users, etc.
- **Serialization**: Converts complex data (like models) to JSON for frontend/mobile apps.
- **Authentication** & Permissions: Manages user access and security for API endpoints.
- **Browsable API**: Provides a web interface for testing and exploring APIs.
- **Validation**: Ensures incoming data is correct and safe.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL helps by:
- **Data Storage**: Reliably stores structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
- **Relationships**: Manages complex relationships between entities (e.g., users and bookings) using foreign keys.
- **Performance**: Supports indexing and advanced queries for fast data retrieval.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforces constraints to keep data accurate and consistent.
- **Scalability**: Handles large volumes of data as the platform grows.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. GraphQL helps by:
- **Flexible Queries**: Allows clients to request only the data they need for listings, bookings, etc.
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
- **Single Endpoint**: Provides all data through one endpoint, simplifying API management.
- **Strong Typing**: Ensures data consistency with a defined schema.
- **Real-time Updates**: Supports subscriptions for live data (e.g., booking status changes).

### Celery
- **Background Processing**: Handles tasks like sending emails or notifications outside the main request cycle.
- **Scalability**: Processes many tasks concurrently, improving performance.
- **Scheduling**: Automates periodic jobs (e.g., cleaning up expired bookings).
- **Reliability**: Retries failed tasks automatically.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Django and other backend components.

### Redis
Redis is an in-memory data store and cache. Redis helps by:
- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed data (like property details) for faster retrieval.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions efficiently.
- **Task Queues**: Acts as a broker for Celery to manage background jobs.
- **Real-time Features**: Supports features like live chat or notifications.
- **Performance**: Reduces database load and speeds up response times.

### Docker
Docker is a containerization platform. Docker helps by:
- **Consistency**: Ensures the app runs the same way in development, testing, and production.
- **Isolation**: Separates services (database, backend, etc.) into containers.
- **Portability**: Makes it easy to deploy the app on any infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies scaling services up or down.
- **Dependency Management**: Packages all dependencies with the application.

### CI/CD Pipelines
CI/CD Pipelines are automated workflows for software delivery. CI/CD pipelines help by:
- **Automated Testing**: Runs tests on every code change to catch bugs early.
- **Continuous Integration**: Merges code changes frequently and safely.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploys updates to staging or production.
- **Quality Assurance**: Enforces code standards and checks before deployment.
- **Faster Delivery**: Speeds up the release of new features and fixes.

## Database Design

The core entities for the Airbnb Clone backend are designed to capture the essential data and relationships needed for a booking platform. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and their relationships:

### Users
- **id:** Unique identifier for each user.
- **name:** Full name of the user.
- **email:** Userâ€™s email address (unique).
- **password:** Hashed password for authentication.
- **role:** Indicates if the user is a guest, host, or admin.

### Bookings
- **id:** Unique identifier for each booking.
- **property:** Reference to the property being booked.
- **user:** Reference to the user making the booking.

#### Entity Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (as a host).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** for a specific **Property**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a specific **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking** and made by a **User**.
